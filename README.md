# PyScript Test

## How to get things working locally
1. Clone this repo
  * For some of the demos you'll need the included wheel files
2. Double click on any of the html files

## Things that are working
1. Basic REPL (Success) `basic.html`
2. CSV Data Load in Pandas (Success) `basic_pandas_data_load.html`

### These ones require custom wheels (for now)
3. Basic Arviz Plotting (Success) `basic_arviz.html`
